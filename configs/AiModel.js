Databases are designed to allow efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data. Data within a database is usually modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying more efficient. Data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.</p><p><em>Key Point:</em> A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient access and management.</p><h3>What is a DBMS?</h3><p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A DBMS provides a way to create, retrieve, update, and manage databases. It essentially serves as an interface between the database and the end-users or application programs, ensuring data consistency, security, and integrity.</p><p><em>Key Point:</em> A DBMS is the software that allows you to interact with and manage databases.</p><h3>Advantages of using a DBMS</h3><p>Using a DBMS offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> DBMS enforces integrity constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency.</li><li><strong>Data Security:</strong> DBMS provides security features to restrict unauthorized access to the database.</li><li><strong>Data Redundancy Reduction:</strong> DBMS helps to minimize data duplication, saving storage space and improving data consistency.</li><li><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> DBMS ensures that data is consistent across the database, preventing conflicting information.</li><li><strong>Efficient Data Access:</strong> DBMS provides efficient ways to access and retrieve data, improving application performance.</li><li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> DBMS allows multiple users and applications to access and share data concurrently.</li><li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up data and recovering from failures.</li></ul><p><em>Key Point:</em> DBMS offers significant benefits in terms of data integrity, security, efficiency, and manageability.</p><h3>Code Example:</h3><div style=\"background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; font-family: monospace;\"><pre>public static void main(String[] args) {\n  int age = 25;\n  System.out.println(\"Age: \" + age);\n}</pre></div><h3>Output:</h3><div style=\"background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; font-family: monospace;\"><pre>Age: 25</pre></div>```"
